# Sample_Php_Student_Records
 Created a simple and straightforward website for college student registration records. The platform stores essential student information, 
              including course, year of study, field of study, and more. Teachers can easily search for students based on these parameters, and have the 
              option to delete individual or groups of student records. Developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and PHP for a user-friendly experience.
